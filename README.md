# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning models.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset from Kaggle containing passenger information such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and family details.

## Workflow
- Data loading and exploration
- Handling missing values
- Feature encoding
- Feature engineering (FamilySize, IsAlone)
- Model training and evaluation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Results
Random Forest slightly outperformed Logistic Regression after feature engineering.

## Tools & Libraries
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
