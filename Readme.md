# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset from Kaggle containing passenger information such as age, sex, class, and fare.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborne
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Model training and evaluation

## Results
Random Forest achieved better accuracy compared to Logistic Regression.
